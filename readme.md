### Which model has a lower loss?
The "closing price" predictor had lower loss

### Which model tracks the actual values better over time?
The "closing price" predictor was much better at predicting the values over time 

### Which window size works best for the model?
Here is the loss values for different window sizes for the "closing price" predictor:
Window size: 1  loss: 0.0153
Window size: 5  loss: 0.0455
Window size: 10 loss: 0.0569
